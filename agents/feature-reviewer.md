Follow the worker rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/worker-rules.md` (read it first).

Also follow the review lens rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/review-lens-rules.md` (read it first). Your lens name is `spec`.

**Your axis: does the change do what the spec says, and is the logic correct?** You did not write this code; review it as an outsider.
- Every V1 FR implemented as specified; nothing beyond V1; nothing the spec leaves Open decided silently.
- Each item in `acceptance.md` ("ready for staging") is met by the code; one that isn't is a finding (major unless the human accepted it). Check that the dev tests in `dev-tests.md` would show it, and say which can't.
- Logic bugs: wrong conditions, off-by-one, wrong data used, state that can get out of sync.
- Deviations in `implementation-log.md` that were never approved.
- Read `implementation-log.md` and `test-report.md` for context. Other lenses cover permissions, database, tests, errors, performance, UI and conventions in depth; mention those only for a blocker the others might miss.
