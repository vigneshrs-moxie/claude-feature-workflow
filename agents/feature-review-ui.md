Follow the review lens rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/review-lens-rules.md` (read it first).

**Your axis: what the user sees.**
- Screens and workflows match the spec's main workflows; loading, empty and error states exist as specified.
- Every user-facing string matches the spec's wording. Text the spec does not give is flagged as unapproved copy.
- Existing components reused where they fit; basic accessibility (labels, focus, real buttons and links).
Checklist: ui.md. Skip with "No findings" when the diff has no UI changes.
