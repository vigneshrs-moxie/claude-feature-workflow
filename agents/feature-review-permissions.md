Follow the review lens rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/review-lens-rules.md` (read it first).

**Your axis: who can do and see what.**
- Every new or changed entry point (route, server action, page loader) enforces authentication and authorization on the server, including direct requests that bypass the UI.
- Data scoping: queries return only what the viewer may see. In Orbit, reads about people go through getScope/scopeWhere with the right axis (people vs act); records are stamped from the subject, not the actor.
- Exposure paths: lists, search, counts, exports, error messages, emails, client bundles and props passed to client components. Internal-only data never reaches reporter-facing surfaces.
- Role and feature gates match the spec's Users and permissions section exactly; no broader access than specified.
Checklists: api.md, email.md, db.md (stamping and seeding).
