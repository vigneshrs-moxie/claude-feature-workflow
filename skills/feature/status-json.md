# status.json and saved briefs

After **every** brief, the conductor writes two files (and the Key points of §3) to the feature's private folder. They are for the Feature Workshop dashboard; `workflow-status.md` stays the human record. If the two ever disagree, `workflow-status.md` wins and the next brief corrects `status.json`.

## 1. `briefs/<nnn>-<stage>.md`

The brief exactly as shown to the human, numbered from `001` and never overwritten (`briefs/001-clarify.md`, `briefs/002-spec.md`, `briefs/003-wireframe.md`, `briefs/004-investigate.md`, …). Stage names as in the schema below. Answers to a brief arrive in the conversation; the conductor records them in `workflow-status.md` as usual.

## 2. `status.json`

Overwrite the whole file each time. Valid JSON, UTF-8, no comments. Use `null` for anything not known; never guess.

### Field rules

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `route` | `quick` (L0, L1) / `small` (L2) / `large` (L3) / `null` (no level yet) |
| `suggested_level` | `0`–`3`: the level you propose (SKILL.md, Start; job-options.md, Level floor). Keep it in later writes; change it only when you propose another level. `null` when you have made no proposal |
| `level_reason` | one line (under 400 characters) why, from the request and the paths touched; `null` with no proposal |
| `kind` | `feature` / `bug` (from the job's options when set) |
| `stage` | `clarify`, `spec`, `refine`, `wireframe`, `investigate`, `spec-update`, `plan`, `implement`, `test`, `review`, `pr1`, `pr2`, `staging-qa`, `pr3`. `clarify` is your own questions before the spec (brief `briefs/<nnn>-clarify.md`; no artifact). `wireframe` is the screens stage (brief `briefs/<nnn>-wireframe.md`, artifact "Wireframes" `wireframes.html` vN, the version from `wireframes.json`). The quick plan uses `plan` (brief `briefs/<nnn>-plan.md`, artifact "Quick plan" `quick-plan.md` vN in `artifacts`); `implement` only once its go-ahead is logged (at L0, the request: job-options.md). Waiting for the human's manual test is `test` with `waiting_for: "answers"` |
| `stage_state` | `working` (a worker is running) · `waiting_for_you` (brief given, gate closed) · `blocked` (cannot continue: say why in `next_proposed`) · `done` (feature finished or stopped) |
| `waiting_for` | `approval` (a go-ahead) · `answers` (questions open) · `permission` (a tool permission prompt) · `null` when not waiting |
| `waiting_since` | when the brief was given; `null` when not waiting |
| `questions` | the brief's "Decisions for you", max 3 (a clarify brief: max 5). `recommendation` is an option `id`; `options` may be `[]` for a free-text question. Each option may carry `consequence`: one line, under 120 characters, on what changes if that option is picked (the dashboard shows it under the option; always filled in a clarify brief, optional elsewhere) |
| `decided_on_your_behalf` | every product or engineering choice you made without the human's explicit answer (for example under a blanket "use your recommendations"). Keep listing it with `confirmed: false` until the human confirms it; then `true` |
| `artifacts` | paths relative to the private folder where possible, otherwise absolute. Versions exactly as on disk |
| `branch`, `worktree`, `base_sha` | from implementation on, as recorded in `workflow-status.md` (worktree path absolute); `null` before |
| `prs` | always the three PR stages from the git workflow. `state`: `not_started` · `open` · `changes_requested` · `approved` · `merged` · `closed`. `url` once the PR exists. Record only what you saw on GitHub; never mark a PR merged or approved on assumption |
| `session_id` | this conductor session's ID if you know it; otherwise `null` (the dashboard finds it from the session logs) |
| times | ISO 8601 with offset |

Also write `status.json` with `stage_state: "working"` when you dispatch a worker, so the dashboard shows work in progress between briefs.

## 3. `summaries/`: Key points

A short summary of each document and brief, shown above it in the Feature Workshop (Key points in the Docs tab, In short on a brief) so the human needn't read the whole thing. Before every brief, write one for each document the stage produced or changed, and one for the brief itself. Write from the file **on disk**, never from memory. Never edit an approved document for this.

One file per document and version: `summaries/<file without .md/.json>[.v<version>].json`, the version exactly as on disk. Examples: `summaries/findings.v1.json`, `summaries/implementation-plan.v2.json`, `summaries/briefs/006-review.json` (briefs have no version), `summaries/spec.v0.3.json` (the product spec, which lives in the repository, is `spec`). Never overwrite another version's file.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "file": "findings.md",
  "version": "1",
  "written": "2026-10-22T10:40:00-07:00",
  "outcome": ["What it found or decided, in a line."],
  "risks": ["What could go wrong or surprised you."],
  "decisions": [{ "text": "What the human must decide?", "recommendation": "Your pick, or null" }],
  "changed": ["What is different from the previous version or brief."]
}
```

Each of `outcome`, `risks`, `changed`: at most 3 lines of about 140 characters; `decisions`: at most 5. Leave a part `[]` when there is nothing to say (`changed` is `[]` on a first version). Plain language; `**bold**` and `` `code` `` are allowed. Nothing the document does not say.
