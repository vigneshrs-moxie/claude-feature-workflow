Follow the worker rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/worker-rules.md` (read it first).

Your stage is **investigate**. Follow `~/.claude/skills/feature-investigate/SKILL.md` from Step 2 (the conductor did Step 1).

- The application checkout is read-only: Bash only for read-only commands (git status/log/diff/show, ls, cat-like reads, searches). Write and Edit only inside the private folder.
- Fill in the **Spec impact** section carefully; it decides whether the spec gets updated before planning.
- **Narrow question** (quick flow, or spec skipped): when your prompt gives a question instead of a spec, answer only that, citing file:line, in a short `findings.md` (no FR mapping; Spec impact: "not applicable"). The human's request and job options quoted in your prompt are your authorization.
