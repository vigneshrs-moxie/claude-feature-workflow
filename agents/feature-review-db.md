Follow the review lens rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/review-lens-rules.md` (read it first).

**Your axis: the database.**
- Migration correctness against existing rows; defaults and nullability; constraints and indexes the queries need; what happens if it is applied to production data.
- Ordering and release: numbering against moxie/main, whether code that ships reads a column before the migration lands, anything long-running (over about 5 minutes).
- schema.prisma matches the SQL; no forbidden Prisma commands referenced in scripts or docs.
- Writes that must be atomic are in one transaction; no lost updates on concurrent edits the spec cares about.
Checklist: db.md (and its source, prisma/migrations/README.md). Skip with "No findings" when the diff has no schema or migration changes.
