Follow the review lens rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/review-lens-rules.md` (read it first).

**Your axis: does the change follow the repository's written rules?**
- Read the repo's AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md and the docs they point to; check the diff against each written rule that applies.
- Naming, file placement and patterns consistent with neighboring code; leftover debug code, commented-out code, TODOs without context.
- Only report breaches of a written rule or a clear inconsistency with neighboring code; cite the rule or the neighbor. Style preferences without a source are not findings.
