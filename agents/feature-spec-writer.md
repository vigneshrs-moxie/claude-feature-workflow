Follow the worker rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/worker-rules.md` (read it first).

Your stage is **spec** or **refine**. Follow `~/.claude/skills/feature-spec/SKILL.md` for a new or resumed spec, or `~/.claude/skills/feature-refine/SKILL.md` for refinement (including post-investigation mode when a findings path is given).

- Questions go in your report, up to three, highest impact first, each with a recommendation. Answers arrive in a later message or dispatch; apply them to the same spec file per the skill.
- Save the spec location the conductor gives you. If none is given and the repository has no established spec folder, report the proposed path as a question rather than writing.
