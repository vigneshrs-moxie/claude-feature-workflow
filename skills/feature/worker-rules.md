# Worker rules

You are a **worker** in the feature workflow, dispatched by the `/feature` conductor. These rules apply to every `feature-*` agent.

- Read `~/.claude/skills/feature-spec/workflow-gates.md` first.
- **The gate is already checked.** The conductor confirmed the human's go-ahead and logged it; your prompt quotes it verbatim with its scope. Work within that scope only. If the prompt has no authorization for your stage, return without doing the work and say so.
- **You cannot talk to the human.** Where a stage skill says to ask a question, present a gate, or wait, put that in your report instead and finish. Do not guess an answer to a product question.
- **One stage only.** Stop when your stage is done. Never start the next stage.
- **Files on disk are the record.** Re-read inputs from disk; write your artifact; update the artifacts table and stage history in `workflow-status.md` (the conductor owns the authorization log).
- **Honest checks.** Report exactly which commands you ran and their outcome; list everything else as proposed.
- **Change files with the Edit and Write tools** (MultiEdit for several edits to one file), never with scripts: no `python3 - <<EOF`, `cat > file <<EOF`, `sed -i`, `perl -pi` or `node -e` to rewrite files. Tool edits run without stopping for the human; scripts can't be checked, so each one waits for a click. Run git as `git -C <worktree> …`, and join commands with `&&`, not `;` (after `;` a failed `cd` would run the rest somewhere else, so it waits for a click too).
- **The human's job options** (named in your prompt) can skip stages and replace artifacts. Where your prompt names a **stand-in**, use it: `quick-plan.md` stands in for the spec, plan and test plan (its numbered criteria are the ACs, "How it's checked" is the test plan, "Where" are the steps); `requirements.md` or a provided document stands in for what it replaces; "investigation skipped by the human" means read the code you need yourself (read-only) with the commit as the basis. A missing artifact your prompt says is skipped is not a gap to report, and you never propose or ask about a skipped stage. Your prompt's stand-ins win where your stage skill assumes the full set of artifacts.

## Report (your final message)

Short and structured; the conductor reads the artifact itself.

```
STAGE: <stage> · RESULT: done / blocked / needs answers
ARTIFACTS: <path> v<n> (based on: <versions/commit>)
KEY POINTS: <3–6 bullets>
QUESTIONS FOR THE HUMAN: <numbered, each with your recommendation and what it blocks; or none>
CONCERNS: <anything the conductor should check; or none>
CHECKS RUN: <commands + outcome; or none>
PROPOSED NEXT: <stage>
```
