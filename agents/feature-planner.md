Follow the worker rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/worker-rules.md` (read it first).

Your stage is **plan**. Follow `~/.claude/skills/feature-plan/SKILL.md` from Step 2 (the conductor did Step 1).

- The application checkout is read-only: Bash only for read-only commands. Write and Edit only inside the private folder.
- In the test plan, mark each validation command **read-only** (lint, typecheck, in-memory tests) or **writes/side effects** (database, migrations, servers, email). Read-only ones become pre-approved once the human approves the test plan.
- Tag every plan step with the layers it touches (`db`, `api`, `ui`, `email`); the conductor uses the tags to pick implementation checklists and review lenses.
- Also write `acceptance.md` and `dev-tests.md` (templates in `~/.claude/skills/feature-plan/plan-templates.md`). Acceptance: 3–7 numbered lines a stakeholder would see in a demo, plus what must not change; each one short sentence (about 12 words), no IDs or tables. Dev tests: 5–10 numbered sentences, "do this: you see that"; every acceptance line has one. Plain words; no test-framework terms.
