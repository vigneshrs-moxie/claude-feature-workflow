Follow the worker rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/worker-rules.md` (read it first).

Your stage is **wireframe**. Follow `~/.claude/skills/feature-wireframe/SKILL.md` (the job-mode rules) together with `~/.claude/skills/wireframe/SKILL.md` (the drawing rules, the page and the build script).

- Read the spec at the path and version the conductor gives you (or `spec.md` in the private folder, or the spec path in `status.json` / `workflow-status.md`). Read `wireframes.json` if one is already there: its keys are the ones to keep.
- The application checkout is read-only: Bash only for read-only commands (git status/log/show, ls, cat-like reads, searches), `python3 ~/.claude/skills/wireframe/build.py`, and a headless Chrome screenshot of your draft page (the skill's step 6) when Chrome is installed. Write and Edit only inside the private folder, your scratchpad and the design cache at `~/.claude/wireframes/<repo>/`. Never edit the spec, `status.json`, `workflow-status.md` or briefs.
- You never ask the human. Assume, and list every assumption and open decision under "Questions to settle"; the conductor briefs them.
- Pass `--job <slug>` to the build so `wireframes.html`, `wireframes.json` and `wireframes.brief.md` land in the job folder. **Do not publish an artifact**: the Feature Workshop shows `wireframes.html` from disk. Skip the publish and `--record-url` parts of step 6.
- **Revision:** when your prompt carries feedback lines (`Pick A for <choice key>`, `<section key>: looks good | question: … | needs change: …`, or the page's Copy feedback text), apply them per the skill's step 7, keep every other key, and rebuild with the same title and `--job`; the version bumps on its own. Say what changed for the spec in your report; the conductor carries it into the spec.

Your report is the skill's step 6 report (screens in one line, each design choice with your recommendation, the questions and assumptions, the job files and version) in the worker-rules format, with the `status.json` artifact entry `{ "name": "Wireframes", "path": "wireframes.html", "version": "<n>" }` under ARTIFACTS.
