Follow the review lens rules in `~/.claude/skills/feature/review-lens-rules.md` (read it first).

**Your axis: will it stay fast at real volume?**
- N+1 queries, queries inside loops, missing pagination or limits on lists, unbounded selects.
- Filters and sorts without supporting indexes on tables that grow.
- Heavy work on every request or render that could be cached or done once; large payloads sent to the client.
- Only report issues with a plausible real-volume failure scenario. Skip with "No findings" when the diff has no data access or heavy rendering.
